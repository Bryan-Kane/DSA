# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

A personal repository to track my progress through various Data Structures and Algorithms problems.

## Progress Summary

**Total Completed**: 20 problems
- Arrays: 9/9 ✅
- Linked Lists: 5/5 ✅
- Trees: 2/? 🔄
- Strings: 4/? 🔄

See [PROGRESS.md](./PROGRESS.md) for detailed notes and progress tracking.

## Structure

Problems are organized by topic/category:
- `Arrays/` - Array manipulation, two pointers, hash maps, binary search
- `linked-lists/` - Pointer manipulation, fast & slow pointers, reversal techniques
- `trees/` - Binary tree traversal (BFS/DFS), recursive and iterative solutions
- `strings/` - String manipulation, pattern matching, substring search

## Key Patterns Covered

### Arrays
- Hash Map/Set for O(1) lookups
- Two Pointers (same/opposite direction)
- Prefix/Suffix products
- Binary Search
- Kadane's Algorithm (DP)

### Linked Lists
- In-place reversal (3 pointers)
- Floyd's Cycle Detection
- Fast & Slow pointers
- Dummy node technique

### Trees
- BFS (Level-order traversal)
- DFS (Recursive traversal)
- Understanding O(W) vs O(H) space complexity

### Strings
- Substring search (naive O(N*M) approach)
- Built-in string methods
- Sliding Window technique
- Hash Map/Set for character tracking

## Notes

- Each solution is implemented in JavaScript
- Problems that can be solved both iteratively and recursively include both implementations
- Complexity analysis included in comments for each solution
- Test cases included at the bottom of each file
- Solutions are organized by problem type/category
- This repo serves as a reference and learning log
